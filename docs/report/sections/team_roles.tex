This project represents an equal collaboration between both team members, with work divided to leverage complementary expertise. Riley Eaton focused on the algorithmic foundations, conducting literature review and writing the complete Algorithmic Background section, researching the evolution from collaborative filtering through matrix factorization to deep neural networks, compiling all citations, and developing presentation slides explaining the technical mechanisms of recommender systems. Aarav Gosalia focused on societal implications, researching and developing content on privacy concerns, fairness and ethical issues, emotional and psychological impacts, algorithmic radicalization risks, and potential solutions, while creating presentation slides for these topics. Riley will present the algorithmic background during the class presentation, while Aarav will present the privacy, fairness, and ethical analysis, with some support from Riley. Both members collaborated on topic selection, overall structure, ensuring smooth integration between technical and societal content, and peer review of each other's work.
